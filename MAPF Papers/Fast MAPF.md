# Fast MAPF - Prioritized Planning Based
**Prioritized planning** has the disadvantage of being ***Not Complete*** and ***Not Optimal***, however, it has the advantage of being computationally feasible.
- **Not Complete.** A prioritized planning algorithm may not find any solution to a solvable MAPF problem.
- **Not Optimal.** The solution returned by a prioritized planning algorithm my not be optimal.
